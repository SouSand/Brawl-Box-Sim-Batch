# Brawl-Box-Sim-Batch V1.0 (Beta)

-----Welcome to BSSR (Brawl Stars Simulator)-----

# About the game:

Unlock amazing rewards like Brawlers and resources on Brawl Boxes, in a command prompt?!
This game is currently on beta, but, I expect to add more functions to the resources later on.
Unlock all Brawlers in game! With the rarities! *Doesn't include lalests*
Be sure to always save your progress! With the .log files, you can save your progress to load later on!
Thought that only had normal Brawl Box? Well, here we have the Normal, Giant, Mega and Omega boxes back! All on command prompt!

# Game Info:
This game is fully made on .bat!
And also made fully by AI! Despise my human bug fixes..
This game includes auto-saving when finishing openning an box! 

# Planning to add:

Resources:

- Chromatic Credits

- Starr Drops (Rare, Super-rare, Epic, Mythic & Legendary)

# Features:

- Visuals, Profile Pictures, Battle Card Pins & Sprays (Ew but very controversial)

- Upgradable brawlers (Level 1 to 11)

# Ideas:

 - In order to win resources to buy the boxes, to make them not free  anymore, but, get them by buying or getting victories on battles. (Coming soon)

 Hot Zone (3v3)

# How to use the box Simulator

Well, at the package you, you will see some files like BrawlBoxSimulatorRunner.bat (Who is the game) and Some other stuff, but, run the BrawlBoxSimInstaller.exe who will install the game for you. 

The game may let some cache after use.
