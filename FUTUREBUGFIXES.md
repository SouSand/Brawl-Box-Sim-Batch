# Future Bug Fixes

Well, at version 1.0 Beta of BSSR, I found some bugs that make the game unplayable, like those:

- #01 Brawlers doesn't get added to the save file correctly.

- #02 Amount of Rewards in boxes doesn't match the normal game because of bug #01

- #03 After a new attempt to run, Shelly just disappears from save and display.

Found any bug? Contact me on Discord:
