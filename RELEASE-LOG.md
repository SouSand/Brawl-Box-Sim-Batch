# HOW TO CONVERT MY SAVE

Well, because of new save type, you will need to convert your save, but, it's recommended to delete and begin from zero, because it can generate some bugs, but, here's how.

1 - At the BSSR folder, drag the old save file to the new BSSR folder called ConvertSave. (The Old BSSR is located at C:\Program Files (x86)\SouSand\BSSR)

2 - Open the "convert-save.bat"

3 - Follow the steps in the screen.

* If you found any bug on any file, contact me. (Contacts are at the README.md)

# What it will be fixed in future updates:

- Shelly duplication (ChatGPT hates Shelly lol)

- Amount of rewards that user gets in a box

- Readdition credits to Starr Drops
